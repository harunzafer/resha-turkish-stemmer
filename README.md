resha-turkish-stemmer
===================
Resha is a fast and "less aggressive" stemmer for Turkish written in Java. It uses a stem dictionary which is generated by [Nuve](https://github.com/hrzafer/nuve) using a statistical language model based on morpheme n-grams. So it returns the most possible stem for a word **without** considering the neighbor words. 

####Main Features
- Less aggressive and more accurate than the other stemmers for available for Turkish such as the one in [SnowBall](http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/turkish/stemmer.html)
- Contains more than 1.1 million word-stem pairs
- Based on HashMap, very fast but uses approximately 800 MB of memory.
- The stemmer class is singleton, thread safe, and lazy initialized

####Usage

    //it is implemented as an enum to guarantee
    //a singleton, thread safe and lazy initialized object
    Stemmer stemmer = Resha.Instance;

    String stem = stemmer.stem("kitapçıdaki");
    System.out.println(stem); //kitapçı

    //If a word contains aphostrope, 
    //the part before the first aphostrope is returned as stem.
    stem = stemmer.stem("İstanbul'da");
    System.out.println(stem); //İstanbul

    actual = stemmer.stem("aaa'aaa'aa");
    System.out.println(stem); //aaa
        
    //If a word is not in the dictionary it remains unstemmed.
    stem = stemmer.stem("xxx");
    System.out.println(stem); //xxxx

####Stemming in Turkish

This part presents a brief introduction to the stemming problem in Turkish and the methodology used to solve it.

In Turkish words are composed of three parts. Root, derivational suffix(es), and inflectional suffix(es)

Example:

word: kitapçıdaki => kitap (root) + çı (der.sfx) + da (inf. sfx) + ki (inf. sfx)
abonelik (stemmed)

Pay attention to the derivational suffix "lik" which becomes "liğ" if a suffix starting with a vowel comes after it. A stemmer must both detect the inflectional suffixes and convert "liğ" to "lik" after removing the inf. suffixes.

Nuve is an NLP library that can perform such complex morphologic analysis (and more) which is required for many tasks like stemming. This complex analysis could be expensive for applications in which there are millions of words to be stemmed.

Resha stemmer is a Turkish stemmer based on a dictionary which consists of already stemmed words by Nüve. The dictionary includes more than 1.1 million word-stem pairs.
